## Operating Systems Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects written in C relating to general operating systems concepts.

These projects were assigned for an Operating Systems course (CS 3113) at the University of Oklahoma during the Fall 2015 semester.

### [Banker's Algorithm](../master/bankers-algorithm/bankers-algorithm.c)

This project implements and demonstrates the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance.

To build/run this project, execute the following:
*  gcc bankers-algorithm.c
* ./a.out < input.txt


### [C Shell](../master/c-shell/c-shell.c)

This project implements a simple shell to create threads for and execute commands entered by a user.

To build/run this project, execute the following:
* gcc c-shell.c
* ./a.out

### [Memory Management](../master/memory-management/memory-management.c)

This project implements dynamic memory management and outputs various statistics on the results of a sequence of random allocations.

To build/run this project, execute the following:
* gcc memory-management.c
* ./a.out

### [Multithreading](../master/multithreading/multithreading.c)

This project implements a simple case of multithreading.

To build/run this project, execute the following:
* gcc multithreading.c -pthread
* ./a.out < input.txt
